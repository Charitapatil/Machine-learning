        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique in machine learning that combines multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. It works by sequentially training models, where each new model corrects the errors made by the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Boosting Works\n",
        "Initialize: Start with a weak learner (often a small decision tree).\n",
        "Iterative Training: Each subsequent model focuses more on the samples that were misclassified by the previous models.\n",
        "Weight Adjustment: Misclassified instances get higher weights, so the next model pays more attention to them.\n",
        "Final Prediction: The models are combined, typically through weighted voting or summation, to make a final strong prediction.\n",
        "Popular Boosting Algorithms\n",
        "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting): Assigns higher weights to misclassified instances.\n",
